# Proton Whitelist

# What is it?

This is a script that when invoked, adds whitelisted games to Steam according to the `proton-whitelist.vdf` file downloaded from this repository and a user customized file found at `~/.config/proton-whitelist.vdf`.

This allows for playing many more proton games out of the box with zero configuration.
